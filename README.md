# Projects

A list of projects that I'd like to work on - for my reference :)

Ticks mean a project is in some sense "complete", but there's almost always more to do with most things!

- [x] Burlap - A simple Dependency Injection Container
- [ ] Box - A more featureful container, built on Burlap
- [x] Junction - A simple router
- [ ] Vodka - A distributed web crawler in PHP
- [x] Countdown Bot - A bot that will take a string of 9 characters and find the longest word it can! For those, like me, who are rubbish at Countdown.
- [ ] Countdown Numbers Solver - Beat the numbers round as well! 
- [ ] Build on Countdown Bot to produce basic spell checker
- [ ] Ansible LAMP - Ansible roles to setup a basic LAMP environment
- [ ] Ansible Jenkins + PHP - Ansible roles to setup a Jenkins server with additional config for PHP projects
- [ ] Email front-end - The front-end portion of a simple SPA to list emails, done in two flavours: AngularJS and KnockoutJS
- [ ] Email back-end - The back-end portion of a simple SPA to list emails, done in 3 flavours: NodeJS, CakePHP and Laravel
- [ ] Planck MVC - A small MVC framework experiment for PHP
- [ ] Space Invaders - A basic clone of Space Invaders in JS
- [ ] Contract Management System - A CRUD app for managing contacts and contracts
